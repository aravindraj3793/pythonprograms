#collections
# #collections is used for assign multiple values in a variable

#array is collection of homogeneous data refered by using common name
int marks=new marks[5]
#marks
#int
#marks[5] limit
marks[0]=10
marks[1]=20
marks[2]=30
marks[3]=40
marks[4]=50

#drawbacks:
#only contain homogeneous data(same type)
#size is fixed

#TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM WE USE COLLECTIONS IN PYTHON
